# TechGram

When building my PC, I was searching the internet for inspiration on how I would want my PC look. I would

scour the internet from pinterest, instagram, youtube, and more. Yes, I did find the insperation I needed but did not 

like how I had found various forms of inspiration from all sorts of different media platforms. 

<br>

So I created TechGram!
